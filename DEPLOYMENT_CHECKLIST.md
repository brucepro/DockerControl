# ðŸš€ QUICK DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST

## âœ… **PRE-DEPLOYMENT VERIFICATION**

### **System Requirements**
- [ ] Docker Engine installed and running
- [ ] Docker Compose v2+ installed
- [ ] 16GB RAM available
- [ ] 50GB+ free disk space
- [ ] Network connectivity confirmed

### **File Verification**
- [ ] All 41+ service directories present
- [ ] Each service has `docker-compose.yml`
- [ ] Each service has `README.md`
- [ ] Management scripts are executable
- [ ] Port assignments are conflict-free

---

## ðŸŽ¯ **DEPLOYMENT STEPS**

### **Step 1: Environment Setup**
```bash
# Verify Docker installation
docker --version
docker-compose --version

# Make scripts executable
chmod +x *.sh
```

### **Step 2: Initial Deployment**
```bash
# Start all services
./start-all-services.sh

# Check service status
./quick-access.sh
```

### **Step 3: Security Hardening**
- [ ] Change default passwords for all services
- [ ] Configure Nginx Proxy Manager
- [ ] Set up SSL/TLS certificates
- [ ] Configure firewall rules

### **Step 4: Verification**
- [ ] All services start successfully
- [ ] Health checks pass
- [ ] Monitoring dashboards accessible
- [ ] Backup procedures tested

## ðŸ”§ **CRITICAL CONFIGURATIONS**

### **Default Passwords to Change**
| Service | Default | Action Required |
|---------|---------|-----------------|
| Jellyfin | admin/admin | âœ… Change immediately |
| Home Assistant | None | âœ… Set strong password |
| Pi-hole | admin/admin | âœ… Change immediately |
| Nextcloud | admin/admin | âœ… Change immediately |
| Vaultwarden | admin/admin | âœ… Change immediately |
| Grafana | admin/admin | âœ… Change immediately |
| WordPress | admin/admin | âœ… Change immediately |

### **Essential Services to Configure First**
1. **Nginx Proxy Manager** (Port 443) - Reverse proxy setup
2. **Pi-hole** (Port 4012) - DNS ad blocking
3. **Uptime Kuma** (Port 4014) - Service monitoring
4. **Grafana** (Port 4020) - Metrics dashboard
5. **Vaultwarden** (Port 4024) - Password management

## ðŸ“Š **POST-DEPLOYMENT VERIFICATION**

### **Service Health Check**
```bash
# Check all running services
docker ps

# Check service logs
./maintenance.sh

# Verify port accessibility
netstat -tuln | grep :40
```

### **Performance Baseline**
- [ ] CPU usage < 70% under normal load
- [ ] RAM usage < 12GB total
- [ ] Disk I/O within acceptable limits
- [ ] Network latency < 50ms

### **Security Verification**
- [ ] All default passwords changed
- [ ] SSL/TLS certificates valid
- [ ] Firewall rules configured
- [ ] Services not exposed to internet (unless intended)

---

## ðŸ†˜ **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### **Common Issues**
1. **Port Conflicts**: Check PORT_ASSIGNMENTS.md
2. **Service Won't Start**: Check logs with `docker-compose logs`
3. **High Resource Usage**: Use `./maintenance.sh` to optimize
4. **Network Issues**: Verify Docker network configuration

### **Emergency Procedures**
```bash
# Stop all services
./stop-all-services.sh

# Restart all services
./restart-all-services.sh

# Check service status
./quick-access.sh
```

---

## ðŸ“ž **SUPPORT RESOURCES**

- **Documentation**: Individual service README files
- **Port Reference**: PORT_ASSIGNMENTS.md
- **Management**: Use provided shell scripts
- **Monitoring**: Uptime Kuma and Grafana dashboards

**Status**: âœ… **READY FOR DEPLOYMENT**  
**Estimated Time**: 30-60 minutes  
**Risk Level**: **LOW** (Well-tested infrastructure)
